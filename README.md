# The Cancer Targetome V2 is Underway!
Stay tuned for updates. We are currently expanding from our original drug set of ~140 FDA approved drugs to an expanded list of ~400 drugs. This includes additonal FDA approved cancer drugs and Knight-specific investigational cancer drugs of interest. 

### Key Links
The updated flattened file of drug-target interactions and accompanying evidence levels can be found [here](https://github.com/ablucher/The-Cancer-Targetome/blob/beta-V2/results_V2beta/Targetome_FullEvidence_210618_All.txt). 

The updated (V2) mysql database dump can be found [here](https://github.com/ablucher/The-Cancer-Targetome/blob/beta-V2/database_dumps/CancerTargetome_2_0_0.sql).

### Additional Parent Databases
The Cancer Targetome uses the following parent databases: DrugBank, IUPHAR/BPS, Therapeutic Targets Database, BindingDB, and the Small Molecule Suite. Additionally, for drugs with no target information in these parent databases, we have done a limited search and pull from PubChem BioAssay.
